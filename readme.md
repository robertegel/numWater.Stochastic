View [concept.pdf](https://github.com/robertegel/numWater.Stochastic/blob/master/concept.pdf) for more information about the models behavior.
This project builds on a previous unpublished group project which built a complex numeric model simulating a water supply systems behavior with multiple processes.
While this project considers uncertain amounts of rainfall, it's [sibling](https://github.com/robertegel/numWater.Stochastic) cares about the social aspects of such a system.
