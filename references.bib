  abstract = {Rainfall is a prime input for various engineering design such as hydraulic structures, bridges and culverts, canals, storm water sewer and road drainage system. The detailed statistical analysis of each region is essential to estimate the relevant input value for design and analysis of engineering structures and also for crop planning. A rain gauge station located closely in Trichy district is selected for statistical analysis where agriculture is the prime occupation. The daily rainfall data for a period of 30 years is used to understand normal rainfall, deficit rainfall, Excess rainfall and Seasonal rainfall of the selected circle headquarters. Further various plotting position formulae available is used to evaluate return period of monthly, seasonally and annual rainfall. This analysis will provide useful information for water resources planner, farmers and urban engineers to assess the availability of water and create the storage accordingly. The mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of monthly and annual rainfall was calculated to check the rainfall variability. From the calculated results, the rainfall pattern is found to be erratic. The best fit probability distribution was identified based on the minimum deviation between actual and estimated values. The scientific results and the analysis paved the way to determine the proper onset and withdrawal of monsoon results which were used for land preparation and sowing.},

  abstract = {Knowing the survival rates of water-borne Escherichia coli is important in evaluating microbial contamination and making appropriate management decisions. E. coli survival rates are dependent on temperature, a dependency that is routinely expressed using an analogue of the Q10 model. This suggestion was made 34 years ago based on 20 survival curves taken from published literature, but has not been revisited since then. The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the accuracy of the Q10 equation, utilizing data accumulated since 1978. We assembled a database of 450 E. coli survival datasets from 70 peerreviewed papers. We then focused on the 170 curves taken from experiments that were performed in the laboratory under dark conditions to exclude the effects of sunlight and other field factors that could cause additional variability in results. All datasets were tabulated dependencies “log concentration vs. time.” There were three major patterns of inactivation: about half of the datasets had a section of fast log-linear inactivation followed by a section of slow log-linear inactivation; about a quarter of the datasets had a lag period followed by log-linear inactivation; and the remaining quarter were approximately linear throughout. First-order inactivation rate constants were calculated from the linear sections of all survival curves and the data grouped by water sources, including waters of agricultural origin, pristine water sources, groundwater and wells, lakes and reservoirs, rivers and streams, estuaries and seawater, and wastewater. Dependency of E. coli inactivation rates on temperature varied among the water sources. There was a significant difference in inactivation rate values at the reference temperature between rivers and agricultural waters, wastewaters and agricultural waters, rivers and lakes, and wastewater and lakes. At specific sites, the Q10 equation was more accurate in rivers and coastal waters than in lakes making the value of the Q10 coefficient appear to be site-specific. Results of this work indicate possible sources of uncertainty to be accounted for in watershed-scale microbial water quality modeling.},

  abstract = {The study of rainfall frequency analysis is important as it guides engineers, policy makers and water planners to design water structures, predict extreme events such as floods or droughts and prepare disaster risk management plans in advance. This paper discussed how Gumbel distribution can be used in analyzing frequency of rainfall in Dowa district. 30 years of rainfall data (1986–2015) for Dowa district was analyzed using Excel and Hydrognomon software applications by employing different statistical analysis and distribution types. The more practical result of this paper was that the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, 25-year and 50-year return periods of maximum monthly rainfall were calculated for the district. It was found out that Gumbel’s distribution is suitable for predicting expected maximum rainfall in the district. From the Gumbel’s distribution using return periods (T) above, the estimated maximum monthly rainfall obtained are: 272.5 mm, 340.4 mm, 385.3 mm, 428.5 mm, 442.1 mm and 484.3 mm respectively. These values are useful for irrigation systems designing, reservoir designing, storm management and water balance modelling in the district. The result of this study can also be used to develop more accurate and reliable models of flood risk management.},

  abstract = {In probability theory and statistics, the Gumbel distribution (Generalized Extreme Value distribution Type-I) is used to model the distribution of the maximum (or the minimum) of a number of samples of various distributions.
This distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years. It is useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. The potential applicability of the Gumbel distribution to represent the distribution of maxima relates to extreme value theory, which indicates that it is likely to be useful if the distribution of the underlying sample data is of the normal or exponential type. This article uses the Gumbel distribution to model the distribution of the maximum value. To model the minimum  value, use the negative of the original values.
The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the generalized extreme value distribution (also known as the Fisher-Tippett distribution). It is also known as the log-Weibull distribution and the double exponential distribution (a term that is alternatively sometimes used to refer to the Laplace distribution). It is related to the Gompertz distribution: when its density is first reflected about the origin and then restricted to the positive half line, a Gompertz function is obtained.
In the latent variable formulation of the multinomial logit model — common in discrete choice theory — the errors of the latent variables follow a Gumbel distribution. This is useful because the difference of two Gumbel-distributed random variables has a logistic distribution.
The Gumbel distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891–1966), based on his original papers describing the distribution.},

  abstract = {The Gumbel distribution has been the prevailing model for quantifying risk associated with extreme rainfall. Several arguments including theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence are supposed to support the appropriateness of the Gumbel distribution. These arguments are examined thoroughly in this work and are put into question. Specifically, theoretical analyses show that the Gumbel distribution is quite unlikely to apply to hydrological extremes and its application may misjudge the risk, as it underestimates seriously the largest extreme rainfall amounts. Besides, it is shown that hydrological records of typical length (some decades) may display a distorted picture of the actual distribution, suggesting that the Gumbel distribution is an appropriate model for rainfall extremes while it is not. In addition, it is shown that the extreme value distribution of type II (EV2) is a more consistent alternative. Based on the theoretical analysis, in the second part of this study an extensive empirical investigation is performed using a collection of 169 of the longest available rainfall records worldwide, each having 100–154 years of data. This verifies the inappropriateness of the Gumbel distribution and the appropriateness of EV2 distribution for rainfall extremes.},

The data were then processed to identify the maximum rainfall received on any one day (24hrs duration), in any week (7 days), in a month (4 weeks), in a monsoon season (4 months) and in a year (365 days period). The data were also analyzed to find out the standard deviation and coefficient of variation during all the four periods of study. The data showed that the annual daily maximum rainfall received at any time ranged between 49.32mm (minimum) to 229.40mm (maximum) indicating a very large range of fluctuation during the period of study. The rainfall data were analysed to identify the best fit probability distribution for each period of study and the trend has been presented in this study. Three statistical goodness of fit test were carried out in order to select the best fit probability distribution on the basis of highest rank with minimum value of test statistic. Fourth probability distribution was identified using maximum overall score based on sum of individual point score obtained from three selected goodness of fit test. Random numbers were generated for actual and estimated maximum daily rainfall for each period of study using the parameters of selected distributions. The best fit probability distribution was identified based on the minimum deviation between actual and estimated values. The lognormal and gamma distribution were found as the best fit probability distribution for the annual and monsoon season period of study, respectively. Generalized extreme value distribution was observed in most of the weekly period as best fit probability distribution. The best fit probability distribution of monthly data was found to be different for each month. The scientific results clearly established that the analytical procedure devised and tested in this study may be suitably applied for the identification of the best fit probability distribution of weather parameters.

Early studies identified the 2-parameter Gamma (G2) distribution as a suitable distribution for wet-day precipitation based on traditional goodness of fit tests. Here, probability plot correlation coefficients and L-moment diagrams are used to examine distributional alternatives for the full-record and wet-day series of daily precipitation at the point and catchment scales in the United States. Importantly, the G2 distribution performs poorly in comparison to either the Pearson Type-III (P3) or Kappa (KAP) distributions. The analysis indicates that the P3 distribution fits the full record of daily precipitation at both the point and catchment scales remarkably well; while the KAP distribution best describes the distribution of wet-day precipitation at the point scale, and the performance of KAP and P3 distributions is comparable for wet-day precipitation at the catchment scale.\&lt;/p\&gt;},
